NOTE
-------------------------

To run the training program, you need to clone the Ultralytics repository by running this command:

git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git

Then, you need to put the all the program files inside the yolov5 folder including the data.yaml
where you must set it to point to the dataset you've prepared (train, val, test)

Dataset:
